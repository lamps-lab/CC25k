# CC25k: A Citation Contexts Dataset for AI Computational Reproducibility [![DOI](https://img.shields.io/badge/DOI-10.17605%2FOSF.IO%2F4H8WU-blue)](https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/4H8WU)

This repository contains the files and code we used to prepare the CC25k: Citation Contexts Dataset for Computational Reproducibility. This is an extended work of our initial project [<b>"Can citations tell us about a paper’s reproducibility? A
case study of machine learning papers"</b>](https://github.com/lamps-lab/ccair-ai-reproducibility).

### Dataset Description

The CC25k dataset is unique in its focus on **reproducibility-oriented sentiments (ROS)** within scientific literature. This introduces a novel approach to studying computational reproducibility by leveraging citation contexts, which are textual fragments in scientific papers that reference prior work. This dataset comprises 25,829 labeled citation contexts from scientific literature published at AI venues, each annotated with one of three ROS labels: `positive`, `negative`, or `neutral`. These labels reflect the cited work's perceived reproducibility. The dataset contains ROS labeled contexts along with metadata about the workers, reproducibility study, related original paper, and citing paper, and the final aggregated labels. The columns in the dataset are detailed in the table below:  


| **Column Name**               | **Description** |
|---------------------------|------------|
| `input_index`            | Unique ID for each citation context. |
| `input_context`          | Citation context that workers are asked to label. |
| `input_file_key`         | Identifier linking the context to a rep-study. |
| `input_first_author`     | Name or identifier of the first author of the cited paper. |
| `worker_id_w1`          | Unique ID of the first worker who labeled this citation context. |
| `work_time_in_seconds_w1` | Time (in seconds) the first worker took to label the citation context. |
| `worker_id_w2`          | Unique ID of the second worker who labeled this citation context. |
| `work_time_in_seconds_w2` | Time (in seconds) the second worker took to label the citation context. |
| `worker_id_w3`          | Unique ID of the third worker who labeled this citation context. |
| `work_time_in_seconds_w3` | Time (in seconds) the third worker took to label the citation context. |
| `label_w1`              | Label assigned by the first worker. |
| `label_w2`              | Label assigned by the second worker. |
| `label_w3`              | Label assigned by the third worker. |
| `batch`                 | Batch number for the posted Mechanical Turk job. |
| `majority_vote`         | Final label based on the majority vote among workers’ labels. |
| `majority_agreement`    | Indicates how many of the three workers agreed on the final majority vote. |
| `rs_doi`               | Digital Object Identifier (DOI) of the reproducibility study paper. |

| `rs_selected_claims`   | Number of claims selected from the original paper for reproducibility study. |
| `rs_reproduced_claims` | Number of selected claims that were successfully reproduced. |
| `reproducibility`      | Final reproducibility label assigned to the original paper by manual inspection (*reproducible, not-reproducible, partially-reproducible*). |
| `org_doi`              | DOI of the original (cited) paper that was assessed for reproducibility. |
